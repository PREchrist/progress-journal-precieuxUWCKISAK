I started to learn programing with "Java" there is one moment ago. After all, I am a student under the cover of Dr. Ruben, it seems appropriate that I know where I am clearly.
I started with what programming, to process programming with WINDOWS, you must start by installing tools such as the code editor and an environment of execution.
-for that we start by downloading the execution environment "ORACLE JDK"                                                                      -Check the execution system of the machine                                                                                                  -Once the download completed, started the installation of JAVA                                                                              -Then installed "ECLIPSE"                                                                                                                  -"ECLIPSE" take the one that fits your system
